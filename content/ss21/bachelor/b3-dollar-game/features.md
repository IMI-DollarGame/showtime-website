#### Levels

With currently 30 levels and three difficulties we have a wide range for beginner to professional riddle gamer. All levels have been created and analysed by our team, to support different skills from coordination on the screen to simple mathematics and calculations.
For a smooth start, a tutorial level with easy explanations was implemented, to take the player by the hand and lead him through his first level. This can easily be skipped for the experts, returnees and impatient.
Our main menu leads the player to the level screen, which allows the player to choose between easy, normal and difficult graphs. Revisitors are able to see their finished levels in the level selection screen.

#### Highscore

The high score system remembers the player's best solution for each individual level. A step counter follows the player through his round and keeps track of their number of moves. The less moves the better. And in case of a misclick, the return button helps to save the players score.  
High scores will be shown in the level menu as well as in game, when you want to improve your play through.

#### Assets and Animation

Self made and self animated, our assets give the game its flair. With our pixelated style and beautiful art, the game starts to shine: 14 different islands, 8 connecting rocks and multiple background drawings were created by our artists. And with a few lines of code, the animation brings the game to its lively state. Not only is our main menu equipped with an animated background, our islands and connections are too! With a simple click of the mouse, you see the islands that share their values wiggle in the sky.

#### Music

With our music and sound features, the player can enjoy atmospheric tunes while thinking about his next moves. Sound effects support the players actions and give audible notifications.
And the player that prefers his own metal playlist for thinking can stop the music with two simple clicks in the sound menu.
