#### Phaser 3 & JavaScript

Early on we knew we needed a framework. With JavaScript as a familiar language to most, we decided to aim our search and found Phaser, an open source HTML5 game framework. None of us knew this framework, but we were able to learn as we went. For some time we were not sure if the need for the framework was there, but in the long run it certainly was a good decision to stick with it.Why JS??

#### GitHub/git

GitHub was an already well known platform for all of us, since it was put close to our hearts in our earlier studies. As we needed a code sharing and version controlling system, we chose it without second thought. In our processes, new features were added in new branches, reviewed by at least another member of the group and merged to the master. This way the whole group was in control of the latest functioning version of the game.

#### Miro

In our Project Management classes we used Miro Board for exercises, homeworks and information.

#### Confluence and Jira

For further organisation in our SCRUM workflow, Jira was a welcome software. With its Roadmap, Backlog and Board functions, the planning of our project was rather simple. Confluence was a great addition to this planning process, since it gave opportunity for shared documents, files and general note keeping.

#### Discord/Zoom

Since meetups in person were still out of question due to Covid-19, we were in need of communication platforms. Zoom was already prepared by our supervisor and was used for meetings with Mr. Jung as well as our project management supervisor, Mrs. Metzner. For our personal group meetings as well as all other communications, we preferred Discord as a familiar platform and main communication device between most students of the HTW. Multiple voice and text channels gave opportunity to organise topics and save important decisions.
