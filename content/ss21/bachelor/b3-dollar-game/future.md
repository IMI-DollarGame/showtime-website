{{<section title="So, what's next?">}}
We still have many plans! Our game currently allows the player to start with any level and any difficulty he likes. We want to encourage a total play through and will implement unlockable levels in the future. Who knows, maybe you’ll be able to unlock some easter eggs too?

Additionally, we are already able to reset singular levels, but what if you want to show it to a friend? As you don’t want to show him a half played game, a reset function for the whole game process is on our to-do list for the future.

#### More Levels

Three difficulties aren’t enough for us. We want to create more complicated levels that challenge you more than ever. But if you are not ready for the hardcore mode yet, we will make more easy, normal and hard levels additionally to the old ones.

#### More Fun

We as the developers only have one perspective on the game. Players are encouraged to give us their feedback. Because only the players truly know what is fun and not, what features they want or what has to get improved.
